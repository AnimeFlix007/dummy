                      Reasons Why You Absolutely NEED Influencer Marketing

                  <p>
                    Over the years, influencer marketing - which has become
                    quite the buzzword for modern marketing techniques - has
                    emerged as one of the most important strategies of social
                    media marketing. Although influencer marketing seems to be a
                    relatively new term, the actual case is not so. Influencer
                    marketing has been there since a long time hiding in plain
                    sight.

                  <p>
                    Gravely affected by the ban, TikTok contested the matter in
                    court and the ruling was given in its favour for the reason
                    that it tracked down and removed content that would
                    classNameify as inappropriate. This resulted in the lifting
                    of the ban on the app.
