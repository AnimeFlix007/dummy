          <p>Updated August 21, 2020</p>
          <b>1. INTRODUCTION</b>
          <p>
            Padhchin Information Technology and Marketing Services Private
            Limited. ("Footprynt") owns and operates Footprynt ("Footprynt" or
            "Foorprynt Pride Platform"), an online marketplace that connects
            marketers with content creators (the "Marketplace Services") on a
            variety of sites hosted by Footprynt and operated by Footprynt or
            its partners (the "Sites"). Footprynt Pride is a member of the
            Footprynt and provides you, and, if applicable, your affiliates,
            access to its Marketplace Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Access to the Marketplace, Sites, and any features, is made
            available under these Terms of Service ("Terms") and the Privacy
            Notice. Upon connecting social media channels to your account via an
            API, you are also agreeing to be bound by the following, as
            applicable to the connected channel: YouTube TOS and Google Privacy
            Policy (as well as Google’s security revocation site, Google
            Security Settings); Facebook’s TOS and Privacy Policies; Flickr’s
            TOS and Privacy Policy; Instagram’s TOS and Privacy Policy;
            LinkedIn’s User Agreement and Privacy Policy; Pinterest’s TOS and
            Privacy Policy; SnapChat’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy; Tik
            Tok’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy; Twitch’s TOS and Privacy
            Notice; and Twitter’s TOS and Privacy Policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            To the extent any terms herein conflict with negotiated agreements
            between Footprynt and a party, the negotiated language controls. If
            you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Marketplace
            or access the Sites. Accordingly, when you use the Marketplace, you
            should check the date of these Terms (which appears at the top of
            this document) and review any changes since the last version. The
            most current version of the Terms will be available at all times at
            app.Footprynt.com.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <b>1.1. DEFINITIONS</b>
          <p>
            In the Terms, (i) a "Marketer" means any person or entity who
            participates in the Marketplace Services directly or by Footprynt
            authorized personnel on behalf of Marketer for the purpose of
            creating Opportunities to use the services of a Creator, (ii)
            "Creator" means any person, entity or group that creates and
            distributes the original content or sponsored social content, and/or
            performs an action, including but not limited to content posted
            through their associated social networks (i.e. Twitter, Facebook,
            blogs, etc.), requested via the Marketplace, and receives
            compensation for such content or action via the Marketplace, (iii)
            "Affiliate" means any authorized entity or person that directly or
            indirectly controls the transactions of the Marketer or Creator. The
            term “control” with regard to this definition means the possession,
            directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the
            direction of the management or policies of an entity, whether
            through the ownership of voting securities, written voting rights
            agreement, written agreement, title or other influence, (iv)
            “Opportunity” means a request by a Marketer for a Creator to create
            content, distribute sponsored social content, and/or perform an
            action through their social network or in person. These Terms shall
            apply to all transactions conducted through the Marketplace.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>1.2. OPPORTUNITIES</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Participating Marketers create and list Opportunities, often as part
            of a larger marketing goal (“Campaign”), in the Marketplace, which
            offer Creators the chance to receive compensation (e.g. cash, free
            products, publicity, etc.) in exchange for creating and/or
            distributing sponsored social content and/or performing an action
            through their social network or in person. There is no maximum
            number of Opportunities per Campaign. All Opportunities accepted by
            the Creator must comply with the requirements set forth by the
            Marketer (herein referred to as the "Requirements") in the
            Opportunity. Each Opportunity listing should contain a complete
            description of the requirements and the compensation to be paid by
            the Marketer. Marketers can also request that other ads be disabled
            on the paid content of an Opportunity. Once an Opportunity is
            accepted by a Creator, the Marketer is solely responsible for the
            review and approval of the Creator’s content and for the payment of
            any compensation (to be received and then distributed to Creator(s)
            by Footprynt) as stated in the Opportunity. Footprynt is not liable
            if payments are not made by Marketer. Marketer retains
            responsibility for payment of any or all approved offers and content
            under review, which will become immediately due and payable,
            regardless of whether or not Marketer’s access to the Platform is
            terminated.
          </p>
          <p>Promoted Posts</p>
          <p>
            To participate in Promoted Posts, Creators must grant Footprynt
            administrative access in the settings page of the applicable social
            media channel. This is a one-time action which establishes access
            for any Marketer with whom Creator is engaged in an Opportunity. For
            example, this permission can be deselected as part of the flow, per
            Facebook’s best practices:
          </p>
          <p>
            https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/permissions#reference-ads_management
          </p>
          <p>1.3. REVIEWS and APPROVALS</p>
          <p>
            While Footprynt personnel may assist in reviewing and identifying
            Creator's posts or actions that violate an Opportunity's
            Requirements and attempt to resolve disputes, Footprynt does not
            have privity of contract with the Creator and cannot enforce the
            terms agreed to between Creator and Marketer. Footprynt reserves the
            right to review and reject Opportunities from Marketers that do not
            meet the Marketplace Guidelines, as defined in Section 7 below.
            Posts which do not comply with the Requirements of the Opportunity
            will not be entitled to the compensation associated with such
            Opportunity. After Creator accepts an Opportunity and delivers the
            requested content to Marketer, the Marketer may respond with any
            requested modifications or may reject the post for failure to meet
            any agreed-upon criteria or for legal compliance issues. Final
            approval and payment to the Creator will occur if the link is active
            forty-five (45) days from approval, follows all disclosure
            guidelines and required elements. The Platform will automatically
            check for active posts and make payments to the Creator on behalf of
            the Marketer. If the automated system fails to locate required
            elements and disclosure, no payment will be made to the Creator and
            funds for the Opportunity will be returned to the Marketer, unless
            manually verified by Footprynt with permission from the Marketer or
            unless Creator makes the required edits. Should Marketer alter the
            forty-five-day payment terms with Creator, whether within or outside
            of the Platform, Footprynt shall not be held liable for any failure
            to make timely payment(s) to a Creator. Instead, Marketer shall be
            responsible for delivery of funds as agreed upon with Creator,
            utilizing Direct Pay or similar means. Further, if Marketer decides
            to pay Creator prior to the forty-five day mark at which Content is
            automatically verified in the Platform, the obligation to keep
            Content live for those initial 45 days is rendered null and void.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a Marketer makes changes to an Opportunity or approves content
            outside of the Platform, (i) those terms may not be enforceable as
            they are not contained within the terms and conditions of the
            Opportunity that are digitally agreed to by Creators, (ii) any
            failure of the Content during the verification process due to such
            changes will be Marketer’s responsibility, including any payments
            owed to Creators for delivering such content, and (iii) Footprynt
            shall not be responsible for ensuring that any items or advertising
            disclosures appear in the content. For the avoidance of doubt,
            Footprynt shall take no responsibility for non-compliance with
            contract terms (including payment terms and the length of time
            content must remain live), enforcement of terms entered into outside
            of the Platform, or any claims, fines, or FTC violations resulting
            from Marketer’s actions or directions to Footprynt
          </p>
          <p>
            Marketer shall comply with all applicable Federal Trade Commission
            and similar rules and regulations and other truth-in-advertising
            laws regarding content Marketer provides or has produced and/or
            published utilizing the Platform. Marketer is ultimately responsible
            for any FTC violations regarding the content it chooses to publish,
            regardless of whether or not Footprynt pushes through approvals in
            the Platform as directed by Marketer. If Marketer chooses not to use
            Footprynt’s automated FTC-compliant disclosures when publishing
            through the Platform, or encourages a Creator to publish outside the
            Platform, Marketer shall defend, indemnify, and hold Footprynt
            harmless from and against any claims arising in connection
            therewith. For the avoidance of doubt, Footprynt’s verification of
            any such content at Marketer’s direction or as a function of the
            platform does not shift liability to Footprynt or waive Footprynt’s
            rights to indemnification.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>2. ELIGIBILITY</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            You must be an adult (as defined by the jurisdiction in which you
            reside) to register as a Marketer or Creator in the Marketplace. By
            registering in the Marketplace, you are representing and warranting
            that all information you submit is truthful and accurate, and that
            you agree to maintain the accuracy of such information. You
            understand and agree that Footprynt will use the information you
            provide in accordance with the terms of the Footprynt Privacy Notice
            (“Privacy Notice”), which is integrated into and included as part of
            these Terms. Footprynt accounts are not transferable, assignable or
            resalable under any circumstances.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>2.1. MINORS</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Minors and their account profiles will be notated in the platform
            with a special banner. Minors (as defined by the jurisdiction in
            which you reside) must have a parent or legal guardian register for
            and establish a Creator account in the Marketplace. Parents or legal
            guardians may also allow minors to use their accounts in the
            Marketplace. Legally emancipated minors do not need a parent or
            legal guardian but may be required to show proof of emancipation.
            All minors must have executed and completed all required waivers and
            releases in order to participate in an Opportunity. For the
            avoidance of doubt, Minors are bound by the Terms, but this Section
            2.1 controls in the event of any conflict with any other section or
            clause within the Terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only parents or legal guardians may bid on Opportunities, agree to
            terms and conditions, execute publicity releases and waivers, and
            receive payment for any opportunities accepted in the platform. In
            addition, any Opportunities in the system pertaining to alcohol,
            tobacco, drugs, medication, or other similar products or services
            that are illegal (as defined by the jurisdiction in which you
            reside) or intended for adults are not available for the minor (or
            their parent or legal guardian) to bid on or participate in.
            Whenever a Marketer engages with a Minor, it is the Marketer’s
            responsibility to follow all applicable laws.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>3. MARKETER TERMS</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            This Section 3 applies only to Marketers participating in the
            Marketplace.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>3.1. TRANSPARENCY and DISCLOSURE</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Footprynt requires clear and conspicuous disclosure by all
            Marketplace participants. More specifically, the connection between
            the Marketer and the Creator that would affect how people evaluate
            the Creator’s message must be disclosed. Any attempt to instruct,
            coerce or manipulate a Creator into hiding the commercial
            relationship between the Marketer and the Creator may result in
            immediate removal from the system and may be cause for Footprynt’s
            termination of any related contracts between Footprynt, Marketer, or
            Creator. Marketer agrees to comply with the Federal Trade
            Commission’s Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and
            Testimonials in Advertising (see generally
            https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/media-resources/truth-advertising/advertisement-endorsements,
            and the Federal Trade Commission’s Dot-Com Disclosures
            (https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-staff-revises-online-advertising-disclosure-guidelines/130312dotcomdisclosures.pdf)
            and all applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited
            to Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. In addition, those
            Marketers who choose not to use the approved pre-set FTC disclosures
            for posts publishing through the Platform, or who encourage creators
            to publish outside of the Platform, acknowledge and agree that (i)
            Marketer, not Footprynt, is liable for any FTC violation, and (ii)
            Footprynt's manual verification of any such post in the Platform
            does not shift liability to Footprynt.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>3.2. PAYMENTS</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Unless otherwise agreed to in a separate contract between the
            parties, Marketer agrees to pay Footprynt all charges made to
            Marketer’s account for agreed-upon fees or use of the Marketplace
            Services in accordance with these Terms. If Footprynt does not
            receive timely payment and the balance in the Marketer account is
            not enough cover agreed upon fees or Marketplace Services hereunder:
            (i) a charge will be made to the Marketer’s credit card or other
            preferred payment method for the balance owed, (ii) Marketer agrees
            to pay all amounts due on its account upon demand, and (iii)
            Footprynt reserves the right to either suspend or terminate a
            Marketer’s account, including deletion of Marketer’s Opportunities
            from the Marketplace until the balance is paid in full. All fees for
            the Marketplace Services which are charged to Marketer account, as
            well as all deposit(s) for future Marketplace Services, are
            non-refundable. Marketer agrees to submit any disputes regarding any
            charge in writing to Footprynt within thirty (30) days of such
            charge, otherwise such dispute will be waived, and such charge will
            be final and not subject to challenge. In the event Marketer’s
            payment method cannot be charged, Marketer account will be locked
            until an alternative or updated method of payment is provided.
          </p>
          <p>
            If Marketer fails to make payment as set forth herein, Marketer will
            be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys’
            fees and costs) incurred by Footprynt in collecting such amounts.
            All prices are in United States dollars and do not include taxes
            that may be assessed by any jurisdiction. If withholding taxes or
            any other fees are imposed by any jurisdiction on the transactions
            pursuant to these Terms, Marketer shall pay such taxes to ensure
            that Footprynt receives the full amount invoiced without offset or
            deduction. Marketer agrees to promptly: (i) update all information
            to keep account and credit card billing current, complete and
            accurate (such as a change in billing address or e-mail), (ii)
            notify Footprynt in writing if it becomes aware of a potential
            breach of security, such as the unauthorized disclosure or use of
            Marketer’s user name or password, and (iii) notify Footprynt in
            writing if its credit card is canceled. Upon termination, suspension
            or discontinuation of the Marketplace or Marketer’s participation
            therein, all outstanding payment obligations incurred by Marketer
            under the Marketplace will become immediately due and payable.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>3.2.1. SWEEPING OLD ACCOUNTS</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            If a Marketer account is or becomes inactive for 180 consecutive
            days, defined as not logging into said account for 180 consecutive
            days, the balance in the account will begin incurring charges for
            monthly inactivity fees. If charged, this fee is non-refundable. The
            inactivity fee is $25 after 180 days, $50 after 210 days, and the
            balance remaining in the account, if any, after 240 days of
            inactivity.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>3.3. CREDIT CARD CHARGES</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            If a Marketer does not wish to send money directly to Footprynt via
            check or ACH, Marketer authorizes Footprynt to charge Marketer’s
            credit card, as approved and provided by the Marketer, in advance to
            deposit funds into the Marketer’s account. Once funds are deposited
            into the Marketer’s account, they may be used at the Marketer’s
            discretion, to purchase Marketplace Services or pay for agreed upon
            fees. Marketer will be responsible for charges resulting from the
            use of Marketplace Services and any applicable service fees will be
            automatically withdrawn.
          </p>
          <p>
            Marketer represents and warrants that it has the legal right to use
            any credit card utilized in connection with any transaction. By
            submitting such information, Marketers grants Footprynt the right to
            provide such information to third parties for purposes of
            facilitating the completion of transactions initiated by the
            Marketer. If the credit card provided was not authorized, then all
            amounts in the Marketer’s account will immediately be forfeited.
            Marketer’s non-termination or continued use of the Marketplace
            reaffirms that Footprynt is authorized to charge Marketer’s credit
            card.

          <p>
            Footprynt reserves the right to modify, suspend or terminate the
            required method of payment for use of the Marketplace at any time,
            although any pending Opportunities will be completed using the
            method current when the Opportunity was listed. If Footprynt
            modifies the terms of the method of payment as outlined in this
            Section 3.3, the Marketer will be contacted by Footprynt or the
            modifications will be reflected in an updated version of these
            Terms. If a user does not consent to such modified Terms, such user
            must immediately discontinue using the Marketplace. A user’s
            continued enrollment after any modifications constitutes its
            acceptance of the terms and method of payment as modified.

            Unless Marketer or Footprynt discontinues enrollment or
            participation in the Marketplace Services, Marketer understands that
            this pre-authorization is valid until the termination of these Terms
            or the applicable Master Services Agreement with Footprynt. For your
            future reference, you agree to retain, either by printing or

          </p>
          <p>
            If a Marketer would like to ensure a Creator’s content is manually
            reviewed for compliance with the Opportunity criteria by Footprynt,
            such service is available for an additional fee. Marketers may also
            request to have Footprynt manage part or all of its advertising
            Campaign for a fee as agreed upon through a separate managed service
            agreement. Interested parties should contact Footprynt directly.

            <b>3.5. CONTENT INFORMATION</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Marketer agrees that Footprynt is not responsible for any aspect of
            Marketer's content or product to be reviewed, shared, sponsored, or
            advertised by the Marketplace’s contracted Creators. Marketer
            represents, warrants and covenants that: (i) all information it
            provides or approves or that is provided on its behalf in connection
            with the Terms and on Marketer’s website(s) is, and will be updated
            to remain, current and accurate, (ii) the website to which any links
            are included in a listed Opportunity will look substantially the
            same to all end users regardless of the end users' location or
            device, (iii) the Marketer’s website(s) does not contain any
            Footprynt-owned or licensed content, except pursuant to a separate
            signed agreement with Footprynt, (iv) Campaigns are run in
            compliance with third party platform terms, and Footprynt takes no
            responsibility for such compliance or third parties. Marketer
            acknowledges that Creators are independent third parties and not
            directly controlled by Footprynt. As a consequence, any blog
            postings or sponsorship of Marketer’s content or product(s) will
            inherently risk negative or unflattering comments about Marketer’s
            content, product(s) or company. Marketer specifically acknowledges
            and agrees that Footprynt (unless the Campaign is being fully
            managed by Footprynt) has no control over any content that may be
            available or published on any blog (or otherwise), and that
            Marketer, even if being fully managed by Footprynt, is solely
            responsible (and assumes all liability and risk) for determining
            whether or not such Content is appropriate or acceptable to
            Marketer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Third party organizations and/or partners that utilize their own
            networks of creators are responsible for their own review and
            acceptance process. Footprynt takes no responsibility for any
            submission, response, comment, or other feedback provided or
            obtained from any third party in response to any Content or use of
            any Content.

          </p>
          <p>
            Marketer may not discriminate based on the racial, physical,
            political, spiritual, age, gender or sexual orientation
            characteristics of the Creator, nor shall the Marketer violate any
            applicable labor or employment law. Forty-five (45) days after
            verification of the Opportunity, payment will be made to the Creator
            by Footprynt for services unless the Creator has violated these
            Terms, the specific terms of the Marketer’s Opportunity, or the
            Marketer has not remitted fees per the term of its contract. In the
            event that Marketer cancels or delays a Campaign or Opportunity and
            the Creator has submitted work in accordance with the Opportunity
            guidelines, the Creator may be entitled to some compensation from
            Marketer if and as indicated in the Opportunity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The terms of the Opportunity as mutually agreed upon by the Creator
            and Marketer are supplemental to these Terms. Marketers are allowed
            to make reasonable changes to any non-monetary Opportunity terms
            without Creator’s prior approval. Should an Opportunity contain
            supplemental terms between Marketer and Creator, the Content shall
            also be subject to those supplemental terms, and Marketer is
            responsible for enforcing those supplemental terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the event of a conflict between the Terms and the terms of an
            Opportunity that a Creator accepts from Marketer, the terms of the
            Opportunity as mutually agreed upon by the Creator and Marketer
            shall control as between that Creator and that Marketer

            <b>4. CREATOR TERMS</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            This Section 4 applies only to Creators participating in the
            Marketplace.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>4.1. TRANSPARENCY and DISCLOSURE</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Creators participating in the Marketplace must clearly disclose in
            their sponsored content the relationship between themselves and the
            Marketers. Footprynt requires that disclosure be made in a
            meaningful way that makes clear to an ordinary consumer that there
            is a relationship between the Creator and the Marketer. Footprynt
            reserves the right to review and monitor the disclosure practices of
            all Creators who participate in the Marketplace and to either
            require greater levels of disclosure (in the event that Footprynt
            determines in its sole discretion that current disclosure practices
            – including placement of clear and conspicuous disclosure - are
            inadequate) or remove the Creator or Creator’s content from the
            Marketplace (in the event of inadequate disclosures). Creator agrees
            to comply with the Federal Trade Commission’s Guides Concerning the
            Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising (see generally
            https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/media-resources/truth-advertising/advertisement-endorsements);
            Disclosures 101 for Social Media Influencers
            (https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/plain-language/1001a-influencer-guide-508_1.pdf);
            and to comply with all applicable local, state, federal and
            international laws and regulations, including but not limited to
            Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, in the preparation
            and delivery of Content. Any violations of the above terms by
            Creator may be cause for termination of any relevant contracts or
            Opportunities involving Creator.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>4.2. CREATOR ELIGIBILITY</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Any Creator may register in the Marketplace (minors must comply with
            Section 2.1 above), but in order to participate in the Marketplace,
            Creator’s social media channel must meet the following minimum
            standards:
          </p>
          <p>Channel must be a minimum of 90 days old;</p>
          <p>
            Channel must have a minimum number of followers/fans to be eligible
            (varies depending on connection);
          </p>
          <p>Channel must not contain a content gap of more than 90 days;</p>
          <p>Channel must be public (accessible to anyone);</p>
          <p>Channel must contain a majority of original content;</p>
          <p>
            Channel must be in a supported language (English, Spanish, other as
            required by the Opportunity);
          </p>
          <p>
            Channel may not contain content that is inappropriate, obscene,
            violent (including hate speech), illegal, or violates the
            Marketplace Guidelines;
          </p>
          <p>
            Creator must not have made any material misrepresentations about the
            Channel’s history, scope, breadth, number of followers, type of
            followers, or anything similar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Creators must periodically review the training materials available
            on the Platform. Creators also agree that Footprynt and/or the
            Marketer, in connection with the Opportunity, may use data collected
            from these connections, pursuant to applicable privacy policies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Footprynt may, at any time, remove or delete a Creator’s account if
            Footprynt deems the account is ineligible for participation in the
            Marketplace.

          <p>
            <b>4.3. CREATOR FULFILLMENT OF AN OPPORTUNITY</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            By accepting an Opportunity, Creator acknowledges that (i) it will
            follow the Opportunity’s parameters, instructions, and guidelines,
            (ii) it has the authority and ability to perform the requested
            service within the stated time period, as applicable, (iii) all
            submitted content will be in the English language or such other
            language as required in the Opportunity, (iv) all submitted content
            or action will be original (not repurposed) and does not infringe on
            any license, copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other
            intellectual property right of any third party, (v) All required
            releases and waivers will be timely executed and submitted, (vi) All
            ads will be disabled in paid social media posts, (vii) all submitted
            content or action is in compliance with the terms of necessary third
            party platforms, (viii) all submitted content or action does not
            include or support excessive profanity, violence, racial
            intolerance, illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia, pornography or any
            other content that promotes intolerance, illegal activity or
            infringes on the legal rights of others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sponsored content posted for an Opportunity must remain linked and
            live for a minimum of forty-five (45) consecutive days (unless
            otherwise specified in the Opportunity) in order for the Marketplace
            to validate the fulfillment of the Opportunity and to earn
            compensation for the posted Opportunity. Unless Creator is a
            participant in PayPop (as described below) or the recipient of
            Direct Pay as determined by a Marketer, after forty-five (45) days
            from publication and upon successful validation of the Opportunity,
            the Creator will receive payment for the completion of the
            Opportunity as agreed upon between the Marketer and the Creator in
            the Opportunity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Creators, as part of any Opportunity they are contracted for, have
            an obligation to keep confidential any and all materials provided to
            them by Marketers. This obligation survives the end, cancellation,
            or termination of any agreements between Marketers and Creators.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>4.3.1. CREATOR FAILURE TO FULFILL AN OPPORTUNITY</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            If Creator accepts an Opportunity yet fails to fully perform and
            meet the obligations thereof, Footprynt may lower Creator’s rating
            in the system, post negative reviews, and potentially remove Creator
            and Creator’s account from any and all Footprynt platforms, and
            Marketer may (i) deny payment to Creator for such failure to
            perform, and/or, (ii) take back any products, documents, or other
            items Creator received. Creator shall promptly return any such items
            requested by Marketer. Any Creator content prior to such failure or
            otherwise paid for is owned by the Marketer who posted the
            Opportunity.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>4.3.2. CONTENT REMOVAL</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            If necessary, a Marketer may request that a Creator’s post in
            response to an Opportunity be removed from the Creator’s social
            media channel or personal website. Footprynt may assist Marketer in
            requesting a Creator to remove a post and additional fees may apply;
            however, Footprynt cannot guarantee removal of the post by the
            Creator. Marketer may also request that an Opportunity be closed
            and/or cancelled at any time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Marketer may owe payment to Creator, whether partial or full, based
            on how much Content was submitted or completed prior to Marketer’s
            request to remove Content or cancel an Opportunity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Should Creator be asked to reasonably modify or to remove content
            posted in connection with an Opportunity, Creator must do so within
            twenty-four (24) hours of receiving such instruction. Failure to do
            so may result in a loss of compensation (including a clawback of
            monies already paid to Creator) and other remedies, up to and
            including removal from the Marketplace and termination for cause of
            any related contracts.

            <b>4.4. CREATOR COMPENSATION</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Creator acknowledges and agrees that the obligation to compensate
            Creator for Opportunity-related advertisements resides with the
            Marketer, not Footprynt. Footprynt merely facilitates such
            compensation on behalf of the Marketers. Marketer is solely liable
            for providing the funds to Footprynt for payment to Creator. While
            Footprynt may be remitting payment to Creator directly; under no
            circumstance does Footprynt accept liability for payment to Creator.
            Footprynt may also deny payments to Creator subject to any legal or
            lawful purpose. Creator agrees that it will not pursue any actions,
            legal or otherwise, against Footprynt for non-payment. Creator
            waives any and all claims or rights of action against Footprynt
            relating to the failure of a Marketer to compensate Creator in
            connection with an Opportunity-related advertisement. In addition,
            Creator acknowledges that Creator is: (i) not an employee of
            Footprynt, (ii) responsible for the payment of all federal, state
            and local taxes on compensation received from a Marketer, (iii)
            responsible for any reporting requirements imposed by the federal,
            state or local government, and (iv) responsible for compliance with
            all other applicable laws and regulations.
          </p>
          <p>PayPop Terms</p>
          <p>
            In accordance with Credit Card charges stated Section 4.5 below,
            PayPop allows qualified Creators to programmatically bypass the
            standard waiting period in Footprynt and receive payment immediately
            following the creation of sponsored social content for brands, for a
            fee. A fee ranging between 10-15%, based on the total dollar value
            of the Sponsored Social Opportunity, is applied to the total amount
            of compensation to be received by a Creator. The expedited payment
            is made directly to the Creator’s PayPal account (if connected) or
            is added to the Account balance if no PayPal email address is
            provided on the account. A valid credit card must be connected to
            the Creator’s account in order to use PayPop. The Creator will be
            directed to add a credit card if one is not already connected.
            Creator represents and warrants that it has the legal right to use
            any credit card utilized in connection with Creator’s account.
          </p>
          <p>
            Determination of which creators are qualified to participate rests
            in Footprynt’s sole discretion. By clicking “Yes, Pay Me” in the
            platform, and connecting a valid credit card, Creator(s) agree to
            pay an early withdrawal fee in exchange for expediting the standard
            compensation process. Once you initiate a request for an early
            payment through PayPop, the action is non-reversible and no refunds
            will be issued to you. Payment is contingent on your compliance with
            the terms of the Opportunity and any other applicable terms and
            conditions. You agree that failure to so comply is a contract breach
            that will result in a charge to the credit card associated with your
            account, and hereby authorize a charge to your account to recoup
            amounts paid. Unless Creator discontinues enrollment in PayPop or
            Footprynt terminates Creator’s participation in PayPop, Creator
            understands that this pre-authorization is valid until thirty (30)
            days after Creator’s last payment via PayPop. A Creator’s request to
            use or acceptance of PayPop is voluntary, and not mandated by
            Footprynt.

            <b>4.5. CREATOR CREDIT CARD CHARGES AND FEES</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            If Creator enrolls in a subscription agreement or agrees to other
            charges to its account, Creator may be asked to provide a form of
            payment such as a credit card or PayPal account. Creator represents
            and warrants that it has the legal right to use such form of payment
            utilized in connection with any transaction. By submitting such
            information, Creator grants Footprynt the right to provide such
            information to third parties for purposes of facilitating the
            completion of transactions initiated by the Creator. Creator’s
            non-termination or continued use of the Marketplace reaffirms that
            Footprynt is authorized to charge Creator’s credit card for the use
            of the requested Marketplace Services. In the event Creator’s
            payment method was not authorized or cannot be charged for any
            agreed upon fees, the Creator’s account will be locked.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a Creator account is or becomes inactive for 180 consecutive
            days, defined as not logging into said account for 180 consecutive
            days, the balance in the account attributable to accrued promotional
            funds and referral fees will begin incurring charges for inactivity
            fees. The Creator acknowledges and agrees that the inactivity fee is
            $25 after 180 days, $50 after 210 days, and the balance remaining in
            the account, if any, after 240 days of inactivity. If charged, this
            fee is non-refundable. For the avoidance of doubt, monies earned by
            Creators via an Opportunity are not subject to these inactivity
            fees.

          <p>
            a. Sponsored Social Content – Content is created by a Creator for
            Marketer’s marketing Campaign and is submitted, posted, displayed,
            or shared to Creator’s followers through his or her personal social
            media platforms. Unless otherwise indicated in an Opportunity,
            Content is owned by Creator, but Footprynt and Marketer receive a
            worldwide, perpetual, fully paid-up, royalty-free, and fully
            sublicensable right and license to share, use, copy, process, adapt,
            translate, display, perform, reproduce, republish, and distribute
            the content or any portion thereof in any and all forms of media or
            distribution methods (now known or hereafter developed), including
            but not limited to television, radio, print, Internet site and other
            electronic communications. Any use, publishing, or distribution of a
            Creator’s content must be accompanied by credit to the Creator of
            that content by use of the Creator’s name, likeness, image,
            username/handle or other identifying representation (to which
            Marketer will receive a limited license). While Marketer has the
            right to reuse the Content outside of its native platform, as
            described above, FTC guidelines state that the connection between
            the Creator and the Marketer (or brand) must be disclosed and the
            Content must be attributed to the Creator. The disclosure should
            also clearly and conspicuously communicate that the Creator is paid
            by or works with the Marketer (or brand).
          </p>
          <p>
            b. Content Production – Content is created as commissioned by
            Marketer, without limitation as to how that Content may be used now
            or in the future. Footprynt will facilitate Creator’s assignment of
            all rights in such Content to Marketer. Marketers purchasing
            Original Content shall own the copyright in and to the Content and
            may use, reproduce, have reproduced, edit for length or clarity,
            publish and exploit such Content in its sole discretion, including,
            without limitation, licensing the Content to any agent or third
            party, copying, distributing, displaying, publicly performing, and
            creating derivative works of the Content. Attribution to the Creator
            is optional, unless the Content is created by a Celebrity.
          </p>
          <p>
            c. Celebrity Creator Content – Celebrity profile accounts are
            generally denoted with a unique banner within the Platform.
            Celebrity creators may need a special contract between Marketer and
            celebrity Creator to be completed, and any such contract shall be
            managed by the Marketer. Marketer and its Client (if applicable)
            understand and agree that in the event a celebrity is requested to
            create, provide, or endorse any Sponsored Social Content pursuant to
            a Statement of Work between Footprynt and such celebrity Creator,
            the celebrity Creator retains ownership rights to the Content and
            any terms surrounding its use must be negotiated in a separate
            agreement between Footprynt and the celebrity Creator. Marketer and
            its Client will be advised of all relevant use limitations for
            licensed celebrity Creator content.

            <b>5. USING DIRECT PAY</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            The Marketplace offers Marketers and Creators the voluntary
            opportunity to use the “Direct Pay” feature to efficiently conduct
            financial transactions for expenses to be reimbursed and special
            payment requests that may occur in connection with a marketing
            Campaign but that need to be paid to Creators immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
            Marketers may choose to use this feature within the platform to
            reimburse Creators for expenses incurred on an Opportunity,
            transactions completed outside of the workflow or platform, or for
            payments that must be released outside the typical 45-day payment
            window. Creators may submit items for payment, but Marketers have
            discretion regarding what will be approved. Funds will issue from a
            Marketer’s account immediately upon authorization of the payment,
            and any amounts issued through the Direct Pay feature are not
            refundable. A transaction fee will be assessed to Marketers for any
            payments facilitated using Direct Pay within the Platform. This
            transaction fee is assigned upon account creation. The Direct Pay
            feature is also subject to a monthly maximum dollar amount, which is
            set and controlled by Footprynt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Direct Pay is solely to facilitate financial transactions via
            Marketers and Creators within Workflow and is not offered for
            Footprynt Discovery users. Direct Pay is not a vehicle through which
            Marketers and Creators can enter into agreements or contracts or
            amend the terms of the approved Campaign or Opportunity.
          </p>
          <p>
            By using Direct Pay, Marketers and Creators agree that Footprynt:
          </p>
          <p>
            Shares no responsibility or liability for any requests made via
            Direct Pay;
          </p>
          <p>
            Shares no responsibility or liability for the approval or
            disapproval of any request;
          </p>
          <p>
            Shares no responsibility or liability for completed or incomplete
            requests; and
          </p>
          <p>
            Shares no responsibility or liability for any disputes in payments
            received or not received.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unless stated otherwise in the terms of the Campaign, Opportunity,
            or other related contract, any disputes over transactions made or
            other failures to act via Direct Pay are not a considered a breach
            of the Campaign, Opportunity, or other related contract.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>6. CONFIDENTIALITY</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>“Confidential Information”</b> means any information disclosed by
            a disclosing party (e.g. Footprynt, Marketer/Partner, Creator) to a
            receiving party (e.g. Marketer/Partner, Footprynt, or Creator)
            either directly or indirectly, in writing, orally, or by inspection
            of tangible objects, other than information that you can establish:
            (i) was publicly known and made generally available in the public
            domain prior to the time of disclosure to the receiving party; (ii)
            becomes publicly known and made generally available after disclosure
            to the receiving party other than through the receiving party’s
            action or inaction; or (iii) is in receiving party’s possession,
            without confidentiality restrictions, prior to the time of
            disclosure by the disclosing party as shown by receiving party’s
            files and records. Receiving party shall not at any time (i)
            disclose, sell, license, transfer or otherwise make available to any
            person or entity any Confidential Information (except to those
            individuals who have a legitimate need to know such information and
            are bound in writing by confidentiality and non-use restrictions not
            less protective than those contained herein), or (ii) use, reproduce
            or copy any Confidential Information, except as necessary in
            connection with the purpose for which such Confidential Information
            is disclosed to the receiving party and in accordance with the
            Terms. Receiving party agrees to take all measures to protect the
            secrecy, and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use, of the
            Confidential Information. Receiving party may disclose Confidential
            Information if required by law to disclose the Confidential
            Information, provided that receiving party gives the disclosing
            party prompt written notice of such requirement prior to such
            disclosure and assistance in obtaining an order protecting the
            information from public disclosure, and provided further that any
            such disclosure is limited to the minimum extent necessary to comply
            with the legal requirement. All Confidential Information shall
            remain the disclosing party’s personal property and all documents,
            electronic media and other tangible items containing or relating to
            any Confidential Information shall be delivered to the disclosing
            party immediately upon its request, and also, upon termination of
            the Terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nothing contained in the Terms will prevent Footprynt, its parent
            and/or affiliates from complying with privacy laws and regulations,
            and if there is any conflict between the Terms and the terms of the
            applicable Privacy Notice, the Privacy Notice shall control.
            Marketer and/or Creator may not issue any press release or other
            public statement regarding the Terms, Footprynt or its parent and/or
            its affiliates without Footprynt’s prior written consent.

            will be prosecuted to the fullest extent under the law, and each
            action is grounds for termination of Marketer and/or Creator’s
            account in the Marketplace and/or termination for cause of any of
            Marketer and/or Creator’s agreements.

            <b>19. MISCELLANEOUS</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            The Terms constitute the entire terms of service and understanding
            between the parties regarding the subject matter contained herein
            and supersedes all previous and contemporaneous terms of service,
            agreements, proposals and communications in all forms of media
            (including all instructions, advertisements, messages and policies),
            written and oral, between any party and Footprynt regarding the
            subject matter contained herein. Only a written instrument executed
            by the party waiving compliance may waive the terms or covenants of
            the Terms. No waiver by either party of a breach of any provision
            hereof shall be taken or held to be a waiver of any succeeding
            breach of such provision or as a waiver of the provision itself. If
            any provision of the Terms is held or made invalid or unenforceable
            for any reason, such invalidity shall not affect the remainder of
            the Terms, and the invalid or unenforceable provisions shall be
            replaced by a mutually acceptable provision, which being valid,
            legal and enforceable comes closest to the original intentions of
            the parties to the Terms and has like economic effect. Footprynt
            shall have no liability under the Terms by reason of any failure or
            delay in the performance of its obligations on account of strikes,
            shortages, riots, acts of terrorism, insurrection, fires, flood,
            storm, explosions, earthquakes, Internet outages, computer virus,
            Acts of God, war, governmental action, or any other cause that is
            beyond its reasonable control. The parties are independent
            contractors and nothing in the Terms shall be construed to create,
            evidence, or imply any agency, employment, business relationship, or
            joint venture between the parties. Neither Marketer nor Creator are
            employees of Footprynt. None of Footprynt, Marketer, or Creator
            shall have any right, power, or authority to create any obligation
            or responsibility on behalf of the other party. The Terms are not
            intended to benefit, nor shall it be deemed to give rise to any
            rights in, any third party. Creators and Marketers may not assign or
            transfer the Terms, or sublicense, assign or delegate any right or
            duty under the Terms without Footprynt’s prior written consent. Any
            assignment, transfer or attempted assignment or transfer in
            violation of this Section shall be void and of no force and effect.
            Footprynt and its subsequent assignees may assign the Terms, in
            whole or in part, or any of its rights or delegate any of its
            duties, under the Terms to any party. Any rights not expressly
            granted in the Terms are reserved by Footprynt, and all implied
            licenses are disclaimed. Headings used in the Terms are for
            reference purposes only and in no way affect the Terms. The term
            “including” is a term of enlargement meaning “including without
            limitation,” and does not denote exclusivity. Footprynt may change
            the Terms and/or the Privacy Notice at any time upon notice
            published on its Site(s). Any use by a Creator or Marketer, their
            affiliates, agents, representatives, employees, or any person or
            entity acting on their behalf, of the Service after such notice
            shall be deemed to be continued acceptance by them of the Terms and
            Privacy Notice, including any amendments and modifications thereto.

            submitted in the form requested by Footprynt. Footprynt reserves the
            right to discontinue offering, and/or modify the Services at any
            time. Except as otherwise specified by Footprynt, parties agree that
            they will direct all communications relating to the Service or their
            participation therein directly to Footprynt and not to any other
            entity. The organization, specifications, structure or appearance of
            any Footprynt property or any page where a party’s information
