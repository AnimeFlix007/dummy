User friendliness and the free-to-use feature increased the traffic on social networking sites. This increased traffic on social media harboured a well balanced demand and supply of content.  Social media sites gave people a platform to showcase their talents to people across the globe, hone their creative side, a new source of entertainment, infotainment, etc. Content creators earned money from their content on YouTube, Facebook, etc. which gradually developed into a source of earning big bucks for content creators from social media platforms. This was possible due to the wide reach that these platforms provided. Until recently, content creators could grow their personal brand organically without having to pay social media sites to reach their desired audiences. However, due to the growth potential and the revenue generation goals of these platforms, lately there has been a downward trend in the organic growth that was once achievable rather easily. Instagram’s algorithm is designed in a way to show you content that they think you might love. This way, Instagram succeeds in getting you to spend more time on the platform and showing more and more ads during that span. Organic growth was simpler earlier and depended majorly on the supply and demand of content in various niches and not on the bucks that content creators paid to these sites to reach audiences. ",

          text: "Users first noticed this decline in organic growth and engagement rates in Facebook, and other social media sites like Instagram have seemed to catch on. A study conducted by Social@Ogilvy revealed that organic growth for brands on Facebook decreased from 12.05% to 6.15% between October 2013 to February 2014. Meanwhile, another article by Neil Patel revealed that organic reach of pages on Facebook had fallen to 2% to June 2016. Whereas, in 2019, this figure hovered around as low as 1%. Given this downward trend, it is not surprising that the engagement rate on Instagram decreased from 1.2% to 0.8%. According to RivalIQ’s analysis, which was based on a different data set, the median engagement rate on Instagram in 2020 decreased from 1.60% to 1.22%. This decreasing engagement rate naturally led to businesses and even content creators and influencers to pay money in order to reach their desired audiences. While this downward trend in engagement rate may have been expected by the brands and businesses on social media, however the changing algorithm has affected influencers as well. As part of their influencer marketing campaigns, brands choose influencers who not only resonate to their brand and brand values, but also those who consistently have a high engagement rate. Due to the latest updates in Instagram’s algorithm, influencers and content creators have come out and talked about how they are not receiving the same kind of engagement levels as before. A low engagement level does not look good for influencers as it impacts the potential brand deals and collaborations. This further affects revenue generation for influencers and existing brand associations. Instagram mainly has certain decisive factors that create your feed, consisting of Interest, Relationship, Timeliness, Frequency, Following and Usage. Understanding each of these decisive factors helps to overcome the challenges posed by Instagram algorithms. Meanwhile, other ways to groworganically are to focus on your core audience, optimize your social media handles, strategize your content, engage with your audience, analyze each post with in-app insights tools. Further, in case you need a little push to grow, consider paid ads as the audience you attract from sponsored posts also help you gain followers that are authentic. Merely due to the challenges that the algorithms pose, social media has not become redundant. In fact, it is quite the opposite. There is more and more quality content being churned out everyday, more and more businesses getting on board to have a social media presence. More importantly, social media is the new marketplace and influencer marketing is the new age marketing.",

This thought later turned into an idea when he discussed it with Spiegel, who thought it to be a multi-million dollar idea. The first version of Snapchat was created by Spiegel and Murphy and launched as “Picaboo”, which was only available to iOS users. The screenshot notification we see today came as a result of the lower than expected recognition of Picaboo. As the iPhone users could take screenshots of images that were actually supposed to disappear within 10 seconds, this defeated the entire idea and innovation behind the app. In September 2011, Picaboo was rebranded as Snapchat and launched. By October 2012, the app was also launched for Android users. Within a year, it also reported that its users were sending 20 million images each day or 231 images per second and by December 2012, the figures rose to 50 million snaps per day.

Seeing the growth of Google+, it is said that Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook announced a company wide ‘lockdown’ so that employees would work on aligning Facebook’s features with those provided by Google+. October 2013 marked the period when Google+ reached a monthly user count of 540 million. The usage statistics show that a lot worked out in favour of Google+. However, one of the things that did not go well with users was the revelation of true identities of people on Google+. Fearing cyber threat, a lot of controversy arose against Google+ leading them to allow users to use pseudonyms. Further, in spite of unique features provided by Google+, people were still using Facebook more than Google, the user engagement difference between the two being massive. For every 3.3 minutes spent on Google+, users spent 7.5 hours on Facebook. The site was redesigned in 2015 to make it more simpler and faster, by adding and removing certain features. It was in October 2018 that Google announced the shutting down of Google+ by April 2019, citing reasons of engagement rates as low as 5 seconds by 90% of its users. The social media site is also seen as one of Google’ biggest failures. However, Google soft launched",

Given the wide usage of the app in India, especially by teenagers, it was only right that the app be banned.  Gravely affected by the ban, TikTok contested the matter in court and the ruling was given in its favour for the reason that it tracked down and removed content that would classify as inappropriate. This resulted in the lifting of the ban on the app.  Following the border clash with China, the Ministry of Information Technology on June 29, 2020, has banned TikTok yet again. This time, the reason being the threats it poses to the sovereignty and integrity of the nation. TikTok has been asked to respond and submit clarifications for the same. The company, however, has denied sharing any data of its users with foreign governments. ",
